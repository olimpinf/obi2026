If you don't want to redo everything and have the ability to print on double page paper (A3 in Europe), you can enlarge the whole pages with the command :

\usepackage{pgfpages}
\pgfpagesuselayout{resize to}[a3paper]
In the opposite case, or if you should keep the " normal-sized paper" you can have a try on the extsizes package which allows to write:

\documentclass[a4paper,17pt]{extarticle}
For the figures, it is more intricate, because it depends on their format, size and aspect ratio.
